Getting Started

    1.-Add Clients and Tests:

        Before you start using the software, you need to populate it with some data. Begin by adding a few test names and some clients. This will allow you to start testing the softwareâ€™s functionality.

    2.- Create Samples and Work Orders:

    *You can add one or more samples related to a single client/work order.
    *Each sample c*an have one or more tests assigned to it. These tests do not have to be the same for each sample, allowing for flexibility in testing different    aspects of a single sample.

    
This process will create a registry of all analyses to be performed by the laboratory personnel.
